# Facilitator.
finds the "facilitator" with pre-entered data.
Created to help me learn javascript, and as a small project to help me keep track of my weekly job in a job rotation type setup.
I used random names, not the real ones.
The calculator icons are from a template I copied when i first started learning JS.
